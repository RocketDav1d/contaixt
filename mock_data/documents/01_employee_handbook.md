Our mission is to deliver pragmatic, high-quality technology solutions that create lasting value for our clients.

## 2. Office Locations

**Munich Headquarters (current)**
Leopoldstraße 120, 80802 Munich

**Planned Relocation**
In January 2026, we will relocate our headquarters to a larger office in Munich-Schwabing at Herzogstraße 42, 80803 Munich. The new office will feature expanded meeting rooms, a dedicated workshop area, and improved accessibility. Further details will be communicated via Slack and Notion beginning in Q3 2025.

## 3. Working Hours

TechVision operates on a flexible working hours model (Vertrauensarbeitszeit) in compliance with the German Working Time Act (Arbeitszeitgesetz).

- **Standard working week:** 40 hours (full-time employees)
- **Core hours:** Monday through Friday, 10:00 to 16:00 CET. All employees must be available and reachable during core hours, whether working from the office or remotely.
- **Flexible window:** You may begin your workday as early as 07:00 and end as late as 20:00. Work outside these hours requires manager approval.
- **Daily maximum:** 10 hours per day, in accordance with German labor law.
- **Breaks:** A minimum 30-minute break is mandatory for workdays exceeding 6 hours, and 45 minutes for workdays exceeding 9 hours.
- **Time tracking:** All employees log their hours in Personio. Consultants working on client projects must additionally track time in Jira for billing purposes.

## 4. Remote Work

Employees who have completed their probation period may work remotely up to 3 days per week. Tuesday and Thursday are designated as team days, and all employees are expected to be present in the office on those days unless otherwise agreed with their manager.

For full details on equipment, VPN requirements, and data protection expectations while working from home, please refer to the *Remote Work & Home Office Policy* (doc_007).

## 5. Annual Leave

- **Entitlement:** 30 vacation days per calendar year (based on a 5-day work week). Part-time employees receive a prorated entitlement.
- **Carry-over:** Up to 5 unused vacation days may be carried over to the following year and must be taken by March 31.
- **Requesting leave:** Submit requests via Personio at least 2 weeks in advance. For absences of 2 or more consecutive weeks, please submit at least 4 weeks in advance.
- **Approval:** Your direct manager approves leave requests. Requests during peak project phases may be subject to team coordination.
- **Company closure:** TechVision typically closes between December 24 and January 1. These days are deducted from your annual leave entitlement, and you will be notified by October each year.

## 6. Public Holidays

Employees are entitled to all Bavarian public holidays (Bayerische Feiertage), which typically include 13 days per year. A full list is published in Personio at the start of each calendar year.

## 7. Probation Period

The first 6 months of employment constitute the probation period (Probezeit). During this period:

- The notice period is 2 weeks, effective any day.
- Performance check-ins with your manager occur at the end of month 2 and month 5.
- Remote work eligibility begins after the probation period is successfully completed, unless an exception is approved by your manager and HR.

## 8. Notice Periods

After the probation period, the following statutory notice periods apply, unless your individual employment contract specifies longer periods:

| Duration of Employment | Notice Period |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Up to 2 years | 4 weeks to the 15th or end of month |
| 2 to 5 years | 1 month to the end of month |
| 5 to 8 years | 2 months to the end of month |
| 8 to 10 years | 3 months to the end of month |
| 10+ years | 4 months to the end of month |

Resignation letters should be addressed to your manager with a copy to Julia Meier (HR) at j.meier@techvision-gmbh.de.

- **Notification:** Inform your manager and the HR team (hr@techvision-gmbh.de) by 09:00 on the first day of illness, via Slack message, email, or phone.
- **Medical certificate (AU-Bescheinigung):** Required from the 4th consecutive calendar day of illness. Since January 2023, the electronic sick note (eAU) is transmitted directly from your physician to your health insurance provider. HR will retrieve it digitally; however, please confirm submission with your doctor.
- **Extended illness:** For absences exceeding 6 weeks, statutory sick pay (Krankengeld) from your health insurance provider applies. HR will assist you with the transition process.
- **Return to work:** If you were absent for more than 5 consecutive working days, please schedule a brief return-to-work check-in with your manager.
