# Travel & Expense Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 3.0
**Classification:** Internal
**Approved by:** Dr. Martin Schreiber, CEO

## 1. Purpose

This policy establishes guidelines for business travel and expense reimbursement at TechVision GmbH. It ensures that travel is conducted cost-effectively and sustainably while providing clear expectations for employees and approvers. All employees are expected to exercise good judgment and spend company funds as if they were their own.

In line with our sustainability commitment (see *Code of Conduct*, doc_004, Section 6), we encourage alternatives to travel where feasible, including video conferencing and remote collaboration.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all TechVision employees traveling on company business or incurring business-related expenses. Contractors and freelancers should refer to their individual agreements for expense terms.

## 3. Travel Booking

### 3.1 Booking Platform

All travel must be booked through **TravelPerk**, our corporate travel management platform. TravelPerk accounts are provisioned after the probation period (see *New Employee Onboarding Checklist*, doc_005). During the probation period, your manager or an assistant can book travel on your behalf.

Benefits of booking through TravelPerk:
- Negotiated corporate rates for hotels and airlines
- Automated policy compliance checks
- Centralized invoicing (no out-of-pocket costs for flights and hotels)
- Travel risk management and duty-of-care notifications

### 3.2 Air Travel

| Flight Duration | Class | Notes |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| Under 4 hours | Economy | Includes all domestic German flights and most intra-European routes |
| 4 hours or more | Business | Applies to intercontinental flights and long European routes (e.g., Munich to Lisbon) |

- Book flights at least 7 days in advance when possible to secure better rates.
- Rail travel is preferred over flights for domestic German travel and routes under 4 hours by train (e.g., Munich to Berlin, Munich to Frankfurt). Deutsche Bahn BahnCard 50 (2nd class) is provided to employees who travel regularly; request one via Petra Neumann.
- Low-cost carriers are acceptable when they provide comparable service and timing.

### 3.3 Rail Travel

- Book via TravelPerk or directly via the Deutsche Bahn app (submit the receipt for reimbursement).
- 2nd class is standard. 1st class is permitted for journeys over 3 hours or when the price difference is less than 20%.
- Use the company BahnCard 50 when available.

### 3.4 Car Travel

- Rental cars should be booked through TravelPerk. Compact or mid-size category is standard.
- Use of personal vehicles for business travel is reimbursed at **EUR 0.30 per kilometer**.
- Tolls, parking, and fuel for rental cars are reimbursable with receipts.
- For sustainability reasons, consider car-sharing or public transport when practical.

## 4. Accommodation

| Type | Nightly Limit | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Domestic (Germany) | EUR 150 / night | Includes taxes; breakfast may be additional |
| International | EUR 200 / night | Adjusted for high-cost cities (London, Zurich, Paris: EUR 250 / night) |

- Book hotels through TravelPerk to take advantage of negotiated rates.
- Apartment rentals (e.g., via TravelPerk's apartment options) are acceptable for stays of 3 or more nights and often more cost-effective.
- Sharing accommodations is not required but appreciated for team trips where practical.
- Loyalty program points earned during business travel belong to the employee.

## 5. Per Diem Rates (Verpflegungsmehraufwand)

Per diem allowances for meals follow the German tax-free rates (Bundesreisekostengesetz):

| Scenario | Daily Rate |
|----------|-----------|
| Domestic travel, absence 8-24 hours | EUR 14 |
| Domestic travel, absence 24+ hours | EUR 28 |
| International travel | Varies by country; refer to the BMF country-specific rates published annually. Common rates: UK EUR 52, USA EUR 59, France EUR 50, Switzerland EUR 64 |
| Arrival / departure day (multi-day trips) | EUR 14 (domestic) |

Per diem is paid automatically based on your travel dates entered in TravelPerk. No receipts are required for per diem claims, as these are flat-rate allowances.

**Note:** If a meal is provided by the client, hotel (breakfast), or at a company event, the per diem is reduced accordingly: breakfast -20%, lunch -40%, dinner -40%.

## 6. Client Entertainment

Entertaining clients is an important part of relationship building. The following limits apply:

| Expense Type | Limit | Approval Required |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| Client meal / entertainment | EUR 75 per person | None (within limit) |
| Client event exceeding EUR 75/person | As needed | Manager pre-approval |
| Total event cost exceeding EUR 200 | As needed | Manager pre-approval required before the event |

- Always document the business purpose and the names of all attendees (internal and external) on the receipt or in the expense report.
- Alcohol is permitted in moderation at client meals but should not be the primary expense.
- Entertainment of government or public-sector clients is subject to stricter rules; consult the *Code of Conduct* (doc_004, Section 3) and your manager.

## 7. Other Reimbursable Expenses

The following business expenses are reimbursable:

- **Conference and event registration fees** (pre-approved, within the EUR 600 annual development budget per the *Employee Handbook*, doc_001)
- **Internet costs while traveling** (hotel Wi-Fi, mobile hotspot)
- **Visa and passport fees** for required business travel
- **Baggage fees** (one checked bag for trips of 3+ days)
- **Tips** at restaurants (up to 10% of the bill)
- **Co-working space** day passes when traveling (up to EUR 30/day)

## 8. Non-Reimbursable Expenses

The following are not reimbursable:

- Personal travel or personal extensions to business trips (flights, hotels, meals)
- Minibar charges
- In-room entertainment (movies, premium services)
- Traffic fines, parking tickets, or speeding penalties
- Laundry and dry cleaning (exception: trips of 5+ consecutive days)
- Upgrades not covered by this policy (e.g., premium economy on short flights)
- Travel insurance (covered by TechVision's corporate travel insurance policy)

## 9. Expense Submission Process

1. **Submit within 14 days:** All expense reports must be submitted within 14 calendar days of the trip's end date or the date the expense was incurred.
2. **Receipts required:** Original receipts (or clear photos/scans) are required for all expenses exceeding **EUR 10**. For expenses under EUR 10, a brief description in the expense report is sufficient.
3. **How to submit:** Use the Personio expense module. Attach receipt images, select the appropriate cost category, and add a brief business justification.
4. **Currency:** Expenses incurred in foreign currencies should be reported in the original currency. Personio will convert to EUR using the exchange rate on the transaction date.
5. **Late submissions:** Expense reports submitted more than 30 days after the trip may be rejected. Exceptions require Finance team approval.

## 10. Approval Workflow

| Expense Amount | Approver |
|---------------|----------|
| Up to EUR 500 | Direct manager |
| EUR 500 - EUR 2,000 | Direct manager + department head |
| Over EUR 2,000 | Direct manager + CEO (Dr. Martin Schreiber) |

Managers are responsible for reviewing expense reports for policy compliance, reasonableness, and proper documentation before approving. Finance (Petra Neumann) conducts a final review before processing payment.

## 11. Reimbursement Timeline

Approved expenses are reimbursed with the next regular payroll cycle (monthly, by the 25th). If an expense is rejected, you will receive a notification via Personio with an explanation. Disputed rejections should be discussed with your manager or Petra Neumann (p.neumann@techvision-gmbh.de).

## 12. Corporate Credit Card

Employees who travel frequently (more than once per quarter) may request a corporate credit card through Petra Neumann. The card is issued in the employee's name and is strictly for business use. Monthly statements must be reconciled and submitted through Personio.

## 13. Policy Violations

Misuse of the expense policy, including submission of personal expenses as business expenses, falsified receipts, or habitual late submissions, is a violation of the *Code of Conduct* (doc_004) and may result in disciplinary action.
