## Pipeline Summary

Our Q4 2025 pipeline stands at **€1,200,000 in weighted value** across active opportunities. This represents a healthy mix of new logo prospects and expansion within existing accounts. Combined with the deals already closed in Q4, we are tracking well toward our full-year 2025 revenue target.

| Pipeline Category | Gross Value | Weighted Value | # Opportunities |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Late Stage (>70%) | €430,000 | €355,000 | 2 |
| Mid Stage (40-70%) | €570,000 | €442,000 | 2 |
| Early Stage (<40%) | €680,000 | €204,000 | 3 |
| **Total** | **€1,680,000** | **€1,001,000** | **7** |

*Note: The weighted pipeline figure of €1.2M referenced in the executive summary includes additional smaller managed services renewals not broken out individually above.*

## Active Opportunities

### 1. AutoParts24 GmbH — Predictive Maintenance Platform

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Value** | €320,000 |
| **Probability** | 60% |
| **Weighted** | €192,000 |
| **Stage** | Technical Evaluation |
| **Contact** | Stefan Vogel (Head of Digital Transformation) |
| **Expected Close** | November 2025 |
| **TechVision Lead** | Thomas Kruger, Sandra Hoffmann |

AutoParts24 GmbH is an automotive parts manufacturer based in Stuttgart with approximately 1,200 employees. Stefan Vogel reached out to us after seeing our case study on the Muller Maschinenbau cloud migration (doc_029). They are looking for a predictive maintenance platform that leverages IoT sensor data from their production lines to reduce unplanned downtime.

The opportunity is well-aligned with our capabilities. Sandra Hoffmann presented our technical approach during a workshop on September 30, and the feedback was very positive. The solution would involve Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and a custom ML model for anomaly detection — an area we are actively building expertise in as part of our 2026 AI/ML practice plans (doc_030).

**Next steps:** Technical proof-of-concept presentation scheduled for October 28. Stefan Vogel has indicated that budget approval is in place and the decision timeline is Q4. Our main competitor in this bid is Accenture's industrial IoT practice, but we believe our mid-market focus and agility give us an advantage.

### 2. Stadtwerke Munchen — Smart Grid Analytics

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Value** | €250,000 |
| **Probability** | 40% |
| **Weighted** | €100,000 |
| **Stage** | Proposal Submitted |
| **Contact** | Dr. Friedrich Sauer (IT Director) |
| **Expected Close** | December 2025 |
| **TechVision Lead** | Thomas Kruger |

Stadtwerke Munchen, the municipal utility company, is exploring a data analytics platform for their smart grid initiative. The project would involve building a real-time analytics pipeline for energy consumption data, outage prediction, and demand forecasting.

We submitted a proposal on October 3 in response to their RFP. The project would be a strong reference for entering the energy/utilities vertical. However, the probability is rated at 40% because the RFP attracted 5 bidders and Stadtwerke has an existing relationship with Capgemini.

**Next steps:** Presentation to the evaluation committee on November 5. Anna Richter will join as the technical lead for data engineering questions. We have also reached out to our Microsoft partner account manager to provide a co-selling reference, given that the proposed architecture is Azure-native.

### 3. FinSecure Bank AG — Phase 2 Expansion

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Value** | €150,000 |
| **Probability** | 80% |
| **Weighted** | €120,000 |
| **Stage** | Verbal Agreement |
| **Contact** | Dr. Claudia Berger (Head of Data & Analytics) |
| **Expected Close** | November 2025 |
| **TechVision Lead** | Thomas Kruger, Sandra Hoffmann |

While the initial FinSecure Bank engagement (€280,000) is still in its kickoff phase, Dr. Claudia Berger has already indicated interest in a Phase 2 that would extend the regulatory reporting platform to cover additional Basel IV requirements and add automated anomaly detection for transaction monitoring.

This is a high-probability opportunity because the client has already committed verbally and it is a natural extension of the current scope. The formal proposal will be submitted by end of October, with signing expected in November and work commencing in Q1 2026.

**Next steps:** Sandra Hoffmann and Tobias Fischer to prepare a detailed technical scope document. Thomas Kruger to negotiate commercial terms (target: same day rate as Phase 1).

## Closed Deals in Q4

### Won: MedTech Solutions GmbH — Clinical Data Analytics (€195,000)

Closed on October 1, 2025. Robert Engel signed the statement of work for a clinical data analytics platform. This is our first healthcare vertical engagement and represents a strategic entry point for our 2026 growth plans. The project will run from October 2025 through March 2026. Lisa Weber is the project manager, with Anna Richter leading data engineering. As noted in Martin's quarterly review (doc_025), this win is strategically important beyond its revenue value.

### Lost: LogiFlow AG — Supply Chain Analytics (€180,000)

Lost in early October. LogiFlow AG, a logistics company in Frankfurt, chose a competitor (Deloitte Digital) primarily on price. Their budget was more constrained than initially indicated, and the competitor offered an offshore delivery model that we could not match. While disappointing, this is consistent with our strategy of not competing on price — we compete on quality, domain expertise, and client intimacy.

**Lesson learned:** We should qualify budget constraints more rigorously earlier in the sales cycle. I will update our opportunity qualification checklist accordingly.

## Sales Team Performance

| Metric | Q4 Target | Q4 Actual (to date) | Full Year 2025 |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Active AEs | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| Opportunities Created | 8 | 5 | 28 |
| Average Deal Size | €200k | €237k | €215k |
| Average Deal Cycle | 45 days | 52 days | 48 days |
| Win Rate | 40% | 33%* | 38% |
| Pipeline Coverage (vs. target) | 3.0x | 2.8x | — |

*Win rate reflects only one closed won / one closed lost so far in Q4 — too early for meaningful analysis.*

Our three Account Executives — Sarah Klein, Maximilian Roth, and myself — are each managing 2-3 active opportunities. Deal cycles have lengthened slightly, which I attribute to more complex evaluation processes at larger prospects (AutoParts24, Stadtwerke Munchen). We are still within acceptable ranges.

## Strategic Actions for Q4

1. **Close AutoParts24:** This is our highest-priority deal for Q4. The PoC presentation on October 28 is the critical milestone. Sandra Hoffmann and I are preparing a compelling demo.

2. **Expand Microsoft partnership referrals:** Our Microsoft Gold Partnership (doc_027) has generated 35% of new business through referrals. I am scheduling meetings with three additional Microsoft partner account managers covering manufacturing and energy verticals in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg.

3. **Industry events:** We are attending and sponsoring at two events in Q4:
   - **Data & AI Summit Munich** (November 12-13): Speaking slot secured for Sandra Hoffmann on "Knowledge Graphs in Enterprise Data Platforms." Strong lead generation opportunity.
   - **Hannover Messe Preview** (December 5): Targeting manufacturing prospects, specifically to generate leads for our Muller Maschinenbau case study (doc_029).

4. **Healthcare vertical development:** With MedTech Solutions signed, we now have a reference client in healthcare. I am working with Martin Schreiber on a targeted outreach campaign to 15 mid-market healthcare companies in the DACH region, aligned with our 2026 strategy (doc_030).

5. **Proposal process improvement:** Following the LogiFlow loss, I am implementing a mandatory budget qualification step before any proposal exceeds 20 hours of pre-sales effort.

## Forecast

| Scenario | Q4 Revenue Forecast |
|----------|-------------------|
| Best Case | €2,450,000 |
| Most Likely | €2,300,000 |
| Worst Case | €2,050,000 |

The most likely scenario aligns with Martin's Q4 outlook in the quarterly review (doc_025). It assumes we close AutoParts24 in November and begin initial work in December, FinSecure Phase 2 is signed but revenue begins in Q1, and the Stadtwerke opportunity does not close in Q4.
