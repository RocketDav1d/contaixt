## Executive Summary

Q3 2025 was a strong quarter for TechVision GmbH. We exceeded our revenue target by 8%, closed a significant new engagement with FinSecure Bank AG, and maintained high client satisfaction scores. Our headcount grew to 78 employees, though the senior developer hiring market remains challenging. We enter Q4 with solid momentum and a healthy pipeline, positioning us well for our 2026 growth ambitions.

## Financial Performance

### Revenue

| Metric | Q3 2025 Actual | Q3 2025 Target | Q3 2024 Actual | YoY Change |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Total Revenue | €2,100,000 | €1,950,000 | €1,944,000 | +8.0% |
| Consulting Revenue | €1,680,000 | €1,560,000 | €1,555,000 | +8.0% |
| Managed Services | €320,000 | €300,000 | €295,000 | +8.5% |
| Training & Workshops | €100,000 | €90,000 | €94,000 | +6.4% |

Revenue outperformance was driven primarily by the Muller Maschinenbau engagement (Projekt Aurora), which entered its most resource-intensive phase during Q3. Additionally, managed services revenue continues its steady upward trend as clients move from project-based work to ongoing operational support.

### Profitability

Gross margin came in at 42%, slightly above the 40% target. Operating expenses were well controlled at €1.1M, resulting in an EBITDA of approximately €370,000 for the quarter. Petra Neumann and the finance team have done an excellent job managing our cost base while supporting growth investments.

### Cash Position

- **Cash on hand:** €1,800,000
- **Accounts receivable:** €650,000 (DSO: 38 days, within target of 45 days)
- **Accounts payable:** €280,000
- **Net working capital:** €2,170,000

Our cash position remains strong. The largest outstanding receivable is from Muller Maschinenbau AG (€210,000), which is within standard payment terms. Petra Neumann has flagged that we should monitor the DSO trend as we onboard new clients in Q4, particularly FinSecure Bank AG, which operates on 60-day payment terms standard in the banking sector.

## Active Projects

### Projekt Aurora — Muller Maschinenbau AG (€450,000)

**Status:** On Track
**Project Manager:** Lisa Weber
**Completion:** 68% (expected delivery: January 2026)

Projekt Aurora continues to progress well. During Q3, the team completed the core data lake implementation using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and established the medallion architecture (bronze/silver/gold layers). Felix Braun led the development of the real-time data ingestion pipelines using Azure Data Factory, and Anna Richter has been instrumental in designing the analytics layer with Azure Synapse.

Hans Muller, CEO of Muller Maschinenbau, expressed strong satisfaction during the September steering committee meeting and initiated preliminary discussions about a Phase 2 engagement focused on predictive maintenance capabilities. Thomas Kruger is following up on this opportunity — details in the sales pipeline report.

Key risks remain around the legacy Oracle ERP data migration, which is scheduled for November. Markus Lang and the DevOps team have been running parallel environment tests to ensure zero-downtime migration.

### FinSecure Bank AG (€280,000)

**Status:** Kickoff Phase
**Project Lead:** Sandra Hoffmann
**Start Date:** September 15, 2025

We signed the FinSecure Bank engagement in late August — a significant win for our financial services vertical. Dr. Claudia Berger, our primary contact, has been highly collaborative during the scoping phase. The project focuses on building a regulatory reporting data pipeline with automated compliance checks.

Sandra Hoffmann is leading the technical architecture, with Tobias Fischer providing security advisory given the strict requirements of BaFin-regulated environments. The kickoff workshop took place on September 22, and the team is currently in the detailed requirements phase.

### MedTech Solutions GmbH (€195,000)

**Status:** Requirements Gathering
**Project Lead:** Lisa Weber
**Start Date:** October 2025

Our newest engagement with MedTech Solutions was closed by Thomas Kruger at the end of Q3. Robert Engel, our contact at MedTech, is looking for a clinical data analytics platform that can handle sensitive patient data under GDPR and MDR (Medical Device Regulation) constraints. Requirements workshops are scheduled for the first two weeks of October. Anna Richter will lead the data engineering work, with Tobias Fischer again providing compliance guidance.

## People & Organization

### Headcount

| Category | Q2 End | Q3 Hires | Q3 Departures | Q3 End |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Engineering | 42 | 2 | 1 | 43 |
| Sales & BD | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| Operations & Admin | 12 | 0 | 1 | 11 |
| Management | 8 | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| Consulting | 8 | 1 | 0 | 9 |
| **Total** | **78** | **3** | **2** | **79** |

*Note: End-of-quarter headcount adjusted to 78 after one late-September departure was processed in early October.*

Julia Meier and her HR team successfully onboarded three new hires in Q3: two mid-level cloud engineers and one data analyst. However, we also lost two team members — one senior backend developer who joined a startup, and one operations coordinator who relocated to Hamburg.

### Hiring Challenges

The senior developer market in Munich remains extremely competitive. We had two senior cloud architect offers declined in Q3, both due to competing offers from larger firms (one from a FAANG company, one from a well-funded scale-up). Julia Meier is working on an updated compensation benchmarking study and enhanced employer branding initiatives for Q4. We are also exploring remote-first positions for specialized roles to widen our talent pool — a topic for the leadership offsite in November.

### Client Satisfaction

Our Net Promoter Score (NPS) improved to **67** in Q3, up from 58 in Q2. This is a strong result that reflects the quality of our delivery teams. The highest scores came from Muller Maschinenbau (NPS 78) and our managed services clients. The improvement is largely attributable to the structured client feedback process that Lisa Weber implemented in Q2, including monthly satisfaction pulse surveys and quarterly business reviews with each client.

## Key Wins & Highlights

1. **FinSecure Bank AG signed** — €280,000 engagement in financial services, validating our compliance and security capabilities. Thomas Kruger led a 4-month sales cycle from initial contact to close.

2. **Muller Maschinenbau Phase 2 discussions** — Hans Muller has expressed interest in extending our engagement beyond the current scope. This could represent an additional €200-300k in 2026 revenue.

3. **Microsoft Gold Partnership renewed** — Our Gold Partnership with Microsoft was renewed based on our Azure consumption and certification numbers. Sandra Hoffmann led the partner review, and the partnership continues to be a key business driver (see doc_027 for the full partnership strategy).

4. **MedTech Solutions won** — Entry into the healthcare vertical with a €195,000 data analytics project. This is strategically important for our 2026 plans to deepen healthcare as a focus area.

5. **Internal tech talks launched** — Julia Meier and Felix Braun launched a monthly internal tech talk series in August. Attendance has averaged 35 people per session, and the initiative is improving knowledge sharing across project teams.

## Challenges & Risks

1. **Senior developer hiring:** As noted above, the talent market remains tight. We need to fill at least 3 senior positions in Q4 to support our growing project load. Failure to hire could constrain our ability to take on new engagements.

2. **Key person dependency:** Projekt Aurora relies heavily on Felix Braun and Anna Richter. If either were to become unavailable, we would face delivery risk. We are working on cross-training within the team.

3. **Accounts receivable concentration:** 32% of our AR is from a single client (Muller Maschinenbau). While we have no concerns about their creditworthiness, concentration risk should be monitored.

4. **FinSecure Bank regulatory complexity:** The BaFin regulatory environment adds complexity and potential for scope changes. Tobias Fischer is closely involved, but we should budget for contingency.

---

## Q4 2025 Outlook

We expect Q4 revenue of approximately **€2,300,000**, driven by:

- Continued high utilization on Projekt Aurora (final delivery push)
- FinSecure Bank entering active development
- MedTech Solutions kickoff and initial deliverables
- Managed services growth from existing clients

Key priorities for Q4:

1. Close AutoParts24 opportunity (see Thomas Kruger's pipeline report, doc_026)
2. Fill 3 senior engineering positions
3. Complete Muller Maschinenbau data migration milestone
4. Finalize 2026 annual strategy and budgets (see doc_030)
5. Launch updated training and certification program (see doc_028)

I am confident that we will close the year strong and enter 2026 with the foundation to achieve our €9M revenue target.
