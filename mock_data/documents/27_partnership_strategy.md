# Technology Partnership Strategy 2026

**Prepared by:** Sandra Hoffmann (CTO)
**Date:** November 5, 2025
**Distribution:** Leadership Team, Board of Directors
**Classification:** Internal – Confidential

---

## Executive Summary

Technology partnerships are a critical growth lever for TechVision GmbH. In 2025, our Microsoft Gold Partnership alone generated approximately 35% of new business opportunities through co-selling and referrals. As we pursue our 2026 revenue target of €9M (doc_030), deepening existing partnerships and establishing new ones will be essential. This document outlines our partnership strategy for 2026, covering Microsoft, AWS, Databricks, and Neo4j, along with the investments required in certifications and enablement.

## Current Partnership Landscape

### Microsoft Gold Partnership

**Status:** Active Gold Partner (renewed September 2025)
**Competencies:** Cloud Platform, Data & AI
**Certified Employees:** 12 (Azure certifications)

Our Microsoft partnership is by far our most mature and valuable. Key benefits include:

- **Co-selling:** Access to Microsoft's partner sales team in Germany. In 2025, four of our ten new opportunities were Microsoft referrals, including the Muller Maschinenbau engagement (Projekt Aurora) and the Stadtwerke Munchen prospect.
- **Azure credits:** €50,000 in annual Azure credits for internal development and proof-of-concept environments.
- **Technical resources:** Priority access to Microsoft engineering support for complex Azure deployments. This was instrumental during the Muller Maschinenbau data migration (doc_029).
- **Marketing:** Co-branded case studies and inclusion in Microsoft's partner directory for the DACH region.

**2025 ROI:** Microsoft-sourced opportunities represented approximately €1.8M in gross pipeline value and €630,000 in closed revenue. Against our investment of approximately €45,000 (certifications, partner event attendance, internal enablement), this represents an excellent return.

**2026 Plan:** Maintain Gold Partnership status and pursue the **Azure Expert MSP** designation. This requires a higher bar — managed services track record, operational excellence audit, and additional certifications — but would significantly elevate our positioning against larger competitors. Markus Lang's DevOps team is well-positioned to lead the operational excellence workstream.

### AWS — Evaluating Advanced Consulting Partner

**Status:** Registered Consulting Partner (basic tier)
**Certified Employees:** 2 (Solutions Architect Associate)

We have deliberately focused on Azure given our Microsoft Gold Partnership, but increasingly our clients are multi-cloud. The AutoParts24 opportunity (doc_026) includes both Azure and AWS components, and several prospects in our pipeline have expressed preference for AWS-native architectures.

**2026 Plan:** Achieve **AWS Select Tier** consulting partner status by Q3 2026, with a stretch goal of **Advanced Tier** by year-end. Requirements include:

- Minimum 4 AWS-certified employees (currently 2, target 6)
- 3 publicly referenceable AWS customer engagements
- $50,000 in monthly AWS customer spend influenced

Sandra Hoffmann will sponsor this initiative, with Felix Braun as the technical lead for AWS enablement. We need to be strategic — we are not trying to replicate our Azure depth on AWS, but rather offer credible multi-cloud consulting for clients who need it.

**Investment:** €18,000 in certifications, €5,000 in AWS Partner Network fees, €8,000 in training materials. Total: approximately €31,000.

## New Partnership Opportunities

### Databricks

**Status:** Not yet a partner
**Opportunity:** Data Platform projects

Databricks is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for large-scale data engineering and data science workloads. Several of our clients, including Muller Maschinenbau, are evaluating Databricks for advanced analytics on top of their cloud data lakes. Anna Richter has significant Databricks expertise from her previous role and has been advocating for us to formalize this partnership.

**2026 Plan:** Join the **Databricks Consulting Partner** program by Q2 2026. This would allow us to:

- Access Databricks' partner sales channel (particularly strong in manufacturing and financial services — our two strongest verticals)
- Receive technical training and enablement at reduced cost
- Co-develop solutions with Databricks engineering for niche use cases

**Investment:** €12,000 (certifications for 4 engineers, partner program fees). Anna Richter will lead the technical enablement track.

**Expected impact:** 2-3 new opportunities in H2 2026, contributing approximately €300-500k in pipeline.

### Neo4j Partner Program

**Status:** Technology user (not a formal partner)
**Opportunity:** Knowledge Graph expertise positioning

We have been using Neo4j extensively in our internal data platform and in client projects where graph-based data modeling adds value. Our knowledge graph capabilities are a differentiator that few mid-market consulting firms can match. Formalizing a partnership with Neo4j would:

- Position TechVision as a recognized Neo4j implementation partner in DACH
- Give us access to Neo4j's customer referral pipeline
- Enable co-marketing around graph database and GraphRAG use cases

The Graph & AI space is gaining significant traction, particularly in financial services (fraud detection, regulatory compliance) and healthcare (clinical knowledge graphs). Both are verticals we are actively targeting in 2026 (doc_030).

**2026 Plan:** Join the Neo4j Partner Program at the **Silver tier** by Q1 2026. Felix Braun and Anna Richter will complete the Neo4j Professional certification. We will develop one referenceable case study from our internal platform work.

**Investment:** €6,000 (certifications, partner fees). Low cost, high strategic value.

- AWS: €400,000 (new multi-cloud engagements)
- Databricks: €300,000 (data platform projects)
- Neo4j: €100,000 (graph database implementations)

## Certification Investment Plan

Certifications are the foundation of all partnership tiers. Julia Meier has incorporated the following into the 2026 training budget (doc_028):

| Certification | Target People | Estimated Cost | Timeline |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Azure Solutions Architect Expert | 4 | €8,000 | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| Azure Data Engineer Associate | 4 | €8,000 | Q1-Q2 2026 |
| AWS Solutions Architect Associate | 4 | €5,000 | Q1-Q3 2026 |
| Databricks Data Engineer Associate | 4 | €6,000 | Q2 2026 |
| Neo4j Professional | 2 | €2,000 | Q1 2026 |
| **Total** | **18 certs** | **€29,000** | |

Key individuals driving certification efforts:
- **Markus Lang:** Azure Expert MSP operational track + AKS Specialty
- **Felix Braun:** AWS SA Associate + Neo4j Professional
- **Anna Richter:** Databricks Data Engineer + Azure Data Engineer
- **Tobias Fischer:** Azure Security Engineer (supports FinSecure Bank compliance work)

## Governance & Execution

Each partnership will have a designated **Partnership Lead** responsible for maintaining the relationship, tracking metrics, and ensuring we meet tier requirements:

| Partnership | Lead | Executive Sponsor |
|-------------|------|-------------------|
| Microsoft | Markus Lang | Sandra Hoffmann |
| AWS | Felix Braun | Sandra Hoffmann |
| Databricks | Anna Richter | Sandra Hoffmann |
| Neo4j | Felix Braun | Sandra Hoffmann |

We will hold quarterly partnership reviews as part of the leadership team meeting. Thomas Kruger will track partnership-sourced pipeline separately in our CRM to enable accurate ROI measurement.

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **Certification bandwidth:** Asking engineers to certify while delivering on client projects creates capacity tension. Mitigation: dedicated study time (4 hours/week) and staggered certification schedules.

2. **Azure Expert MSP audit complexity:** The operational excellence audit is rigorous and typically takes 3-6 months. Mitigation: begin preparation in Q1 2026 with Markus Lang leading the readiness assessment.

3. **AWS cannibalization concern:** Some Microsoft partner managers may view our AWS investment negatively. Mitigation: clear messaging that Azure remains our primary platform; AWS is for multi-cloud client needs.

4. **Partnership overhead:** Managing four active partnerships requires time and attention. Mitigation: dedicated partnership leads (above) and streamlined reporting.
