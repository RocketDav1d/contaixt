# Remote Work & Home Office Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 2.5
**Classification:** Internal
**Approved by:** Dr. Martin Schreiber, CEO

## 1. Purpose

This policy defines the terms and conditions for remote work (Home Office) at TechVision GmbH. Remote work is a valued part of our work culture and contributes to employee satisfaction, productivity, and work-life balance. This policy ensures that remote work is conducted in a manner that maintains collaboration, security, and compliance with German labor law and data protection regulations.

## 2. Eligibility

Remote work is available to all TechVision employees who meet the following criteria:

- **Probation period completed:** Employees must have successfully completed the 6-month probation period (see *Employee Handbook*, doc_001, Section 7) before becoming eligible for regular remote work. During the probation period, employees are expected to work from the office full-time to facilitate onboarding, team integration, and learning.
- **Role suitability:** The employee's role must be suitable for remote execution. Most roles at TechVision (engineering, consulting, project management, corporate functions) are eligible. Exceptions may apply for roles requiring physical presence (e.g., office management, hardware-dependent tasks).
- **Manager agreement:** Remote work arrangements are agreed upon between the employee and their direct manager. There is no need for a formal written addendum unless the employee requests one.

**Exception during probation:** In special circumstances (e.g., long commute, personal situation), limited remote work during the probation period may be approved by the direct manager in consultation with Julia Meier (HR).

## 3. Remote Work Schedule

- **Maximum remote days:** Up to **3 days per week** may be worked from home.
- **Minimum office days:** Employees must be present in the Munich office at least **2 days per week**.
- **Team days:** **Tuesday and Thursday** are designated team days. All employees are expected to be in the office on these days to facilitate in-person collaboration, team meetings, and social interaction. Exceptions for specific weeks may be approved by your manager (e.g., when traveling for client work).
- **Flexibility:** The remaining days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) may be worked from home or from the office at the employee's discretion. There is no requirement to declare a fixed remote schedule, but predictability is appreciated by your team.
- **Full remote weeks:** Consecutive full remote weeks are generally not permitted. If you need an extended remote period (e.g., while waiting for a visa appointment, family circumstances), discuss it with your manager and HR.

## 4. Working Hours and Availability

Remote work does not change your working hour obligations as defined in the *Employee Handbook* (doc_001, Section 3):

- **Core hours:** You must be reachable and available during core hours, **10:00 to 16:00 CET**, Monday through Friday.
- **Communication:** Keep your Slack status up to date (e.g., "Working remotely," "In a meeting," "Away - back at 14:00"). Respond to Slack messages and emails within a reasonable timeframe during core hours (generally within 1 hour for direct messages).
- **Meetings:** Join all scheduled meetings on time, with camera on for team meetings and client calls. Ensure your internet connection and audio/video setup are reliable.
- **Calendar:** Keep your Google Calendar up to date with your working location (office or remote) so colleagues can plan accordingly.

## 5. Home Office Equipment

TechVision provides the following support for employees setting up a home workspace:

### 5.1 One-Time Home Office Budget

Each eligible employee receives a **one-time budget of EUR 500** for home office equipment. This budget may be used for:

- Desk and/or ergonomic desk chair
- Desk lamp
- Keyboard, mouse, or other peripherals
- Headset or webcam (if not provided by IT)
- Cable management and desk organization

Submit receipts via Personio within 30 days of purchase. This budget is available once per employment period and does not renew annually.

### 5.2 Company-Provided Equipment

The following equipment is provided directly by TechVision (via Markus Lang's IT team):

- **Laptop:** Your company-issued MacBook Pro or ThinkPad (same device used in the office)
- **External monitor:** One external monitor (27" 4K) is provided on request for home use. Contact Markus Lang (m.lang@techvision-gmbh.de) or post in #it-support on Slack.
- **Headset:** A quality headset (Jabra Evolve2 75) is provided to all employees for remote meetings.

All company-provided equipment remains the property of TechVision and must be returned upon termination of employment.

### 5.3 Internet Connection

Employees are responsible for maintaining a reliable internet connection at their home office. A minimum speed of 50 Mbps download / 10 Mbps upload is recommended for comfortable video conferencing and development work. TechVision does not reimburse home internet costs, as this is considered a standard household expense.

## 6. Security Requirements

Remote work introduces additional security considerations. All employees working remotely must comply with the *Information Security Policy* (doc_002) and the following specific requirements:

### 6.1 VPN

**A VPN connection is mandatory for all remote work.** Connect to the TechVision network via Tailscale before accessing any company resources (email, Slack, Notion, GitHub, cloud consoles, internal tools). The Tailscale client is pre-configured on your company laptop during onboarding (see doc_005).

### 6.2 Device Security

- Use only your company-issued laptop for work. Do not use personal devices to access client data, source code, or production systems (see *Information Security Policy*, doc_002, Section 5.2).
- Ensure your laptop is up to date with the latest OS and security patches (enforced automatically via MDM).
- Lock your screen whenever you step away from your workstation, even at home.
- Do not leave your laptop unattended in shared spaces (e.g., co-working spaces, cafes, hotel lobbies).

### 6.3 Data Protection at Home

In addition to the *Data Protection & GDPR Compliance Guidelines* (doc_003), the following rules apply when working from home:

- **No screen sharing in public:** Do not work with Confidential or Restricted data visible on your screen in public spaces (cafes, trains, airports). Use a privacy screen filter when working in semi-public environments.
- **Clean desk at home:** At the end of each workday, ensure that printed documents containing business or client information are stored securely (e.g., in a locked drawer). Shred documents when no longer needed.
- **Phone and video calls:** Conduct confidential calls in a private room. Do not discuss client names, project details, or sensitive business information in spaces where unauthorized persons can overhear.
- **Household members:** Ensure that household members (including children) cannot access your work device or view your screen during work hours.
- **Printing:** Avoid printing Confidential or Restricted documents at home. If printing is necessary, securely shred the documents after use.

## 7. Ergonomics

TechVision encourages all remote workers to set up an ergonomic home workspace. An ergonomic setup reduces the risk of musculoskeletal strain and improves comfort and productivity.

### Ergonomics Checklist

- [ ] **Chair:** Adjustable height, lumbar support, armrests. Feet flat on the floor or on a footrest.
- [ ] **Desk:** Height allows forearms to be roughly parallel to the floor when typing. Consider a sit-stand desk for variety.
- [ ] **Monitor:** Top of the screen at or slightly below eye level, approximately arm's length away. Use the company-provided external monitor rather than the laptop screen for extended work.
- [ ] **Keyboard and mouse:** Positioned so wrists are in a neutral, straight position. An external keyboard is recommended when using an external monitor.
- [ ] **Lighting:** Adequate ambient lighting to avoid eye strain. Avoid glare on the screen from windows or overhead lights.
- [ ] **Breaks:** Take regular breaks (at least 5 minutes every hour). Use the 20-20-20 rule for eye strain: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

If you experience discomfort or pain related to your workstation setup, contact Julia Meier (HR) to discuss options, including an ergonomic assessment or additional equipment funding.

## 8. Work from Abroad (Workation)

Temporary work from outside Germany is possible under certain conditions but requires prior approval:

- **Within the EU/EEA:** Up to 20 working days per calendar year may be worked from another EU/EEA country. Submit a request to your manager and HR at least 2 weeks in advance.
- **Outside the EU/EEA:** Requires individual assessment due to tax, social security, and data protection implications. Submit a request at least 4 weeks in advance.
- **Requirements:** Adequate internet connection, compliance with all security requirements (VPN, device security), and availability during CET core hours (10:00-16:00). Time zone differences of more than 3 hours from CET require manager approval regarding adjusted core hours.
- **Not permitted:** Countries subject to EU sanctions or where TechVision's cyber insurance does not provide coverage. Contact Tobias Fischer for clarification.

## 9. Insurance and Liability

- **Work accident insurance (gesetzliche Unfallversicherung):** German statutory work accident insurance covers remote work in designated home office spaces during working hours, in accordance with Section 8 SGB VII as amended.
- **Equipment liability:** TechVision's corporate insurance covers company-owned equipment against damage and theft, including when used at home. Report any damage or loss immediately to IT (#it-support) and HR.

## 10. Termination of Remote Work

Remote work privileges may be adjusted or revoked in the following circumstances:

- Performance concerns that may be related to the remote work arrangement
- Repeated failure to comply with security or availability requirements
- Business needs requiring increased in-office presence (e.g., critical project phase, client requirements)
- Changes to the employee's role that require physical presence

Any changes to remote work arrangements will be communicated with at least 2 weeks' notice and discussed with the affected employee.
