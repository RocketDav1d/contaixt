# TechVision Code of Conduct

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025
**Version:** 2.0
**Approved by:** Dr. Martin Schreiber, CEO

## A Message from Our CEO

At TechVision, we believe that sustainable business success is built on trust, integrity, and respect. As we continue to grow, it is essential that every member of our team understands the standards of conduct we hold ourselves to -- not because they are required, but because they reflect who we are.

This Code of Conduct sets out the principles that guide our behavior toward colleagues, clients, partners, and the communities we serve. I ask every employee to read this document carefully, to ask questions when situations are unclear, and to speak up when something does not feel right.

-- Dr. Martin Schreiber, CEO

## 1. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all employees, contractors, interns, and temporary staff of TechVision GmbH. It governs professional conduct in all business contexts, including the office, client sites, remote work environments, company events, and online communications.

## 2. Professional Ethics and Integrity

We conduct our business with honesty, fairness, and transparency. Every TechVision employee is expected to:

- Act in the best interest of the company and its clients
- Deliver on commitments and communicate proactively when challenges arise
- Provide honest and accurate information in all business dealings
- Respect intellectual property, including client IP, open-source licenses, and third-party content
- Maintain confidentiality of proprietary and client information, in accordance with the *Information Security Policy* (doc_002) and *Data Protection & GDPR Compliance Guidelines* (doc_003)

## 3. Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery

TechVision has zero tolerance for corruption and bribery in any form. We comply with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the German Criminal Code (StGB, Sections 299, 331-335) and, where applicable, the UK Bribery Act and US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

**Specific rules:**

- **Gifts and hospitality:** Gifts to or from business partners with a value exceeding **EUR 50** must be reported to your manager and the HR department (j.meier@techvision-gmbh.de). Gifts exceeding EUR 150 are prohibited unless expressly approved by the CEO.
- **Cash gifts:** Giving or receiving cash or cash equivalents (gift cards, vouchers) is prohibited under all circumstances.
- **Government officials:** Special restrictions apply to any gifts, hospitality, or payments involving government officials or public-sector clients. Consult the CEO before any such engagement.
- **Facilitation payments:** TechVision does not make or accept facilitation payments.

When in doubt about whether a gift, invitation, or payment is appropriate, err on the side of caution and consult your manager or the HR department.

## 4. Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when your personal interests or relationships could influence, or appear to influence, your professional judgment or actions at TechVision.

**Disclosure requirement:** You must disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest to your manager and HR. Examples include:

- Financial interest in a client, vendor, or competitor of TechVision
- A close personal relationship with someone at a client or vendor organization who is involved in business decisions
- Outside employment or consulting engagements that overlap with TechVision's business
- Board memberships or advisory roles with organizations in our industry

Disclosure does not automatically disqualify you from a particular role or project. Many conflicts can be managed through transparency and appropriate safeguards. The important thing is to disclose early.

## 5. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

TechVision is committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace where every person is treated with dignity and respect, regardless of:

- Age, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation
- Ethnic origin, nationality, or race
- Religion or belief
- Disability or chronic illness
- Social background or family status

We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, bullying, or any form of hostile behavior. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments, jokes, or imagery related to protected characteristics
- Unwelcome physical contact or sexual advances
- Deliberate exclusion or marginalization of colleagues
- Retaliation against anyone who reports misconduct

If you experience or witness behavior that violates these standards, please report it to Julia Meier (j.meier@techvision-gmbh.de) or through our whistleblower channel (see Section 7). All reports are treated confidentially and investigated promptly.

## 6. Sustainability Commitment

TechVision recognizes its responsibility to minimize its environmental impact and contribute to a sustainable future. We are committed to:

- **Reducing our carbon footprint:** Prioritizing remote collaboration over travel where feasible, using energy-efficient office infrastructure, and choosing green hosting providers for our cloud workloads.
- **Sustainable procurement:** Preferring vendors and suppliers that demonstrate environmental responsibility. Our hardware lifecycle targets a minimum 4-year usage period before responsible recycling.
- **Awareness:** Encouraging employees to adopt sustainable practices, both professionally and personally. The Green Team (volunteer group) organizes quarterly initiatives and is open to all employees.

Our travel policy (see *Travel & Expense Policy*, doc_006) reflects our sustainability commitment by encouraging rail travel over short-haul flights within Germany and central Europe.

## 7. Whistleblower Protection

TechVision provides safe channels for reporting misconduct, in compliance with the EU Whistleblower Directive (2019/1937) and the German Whistleblower Protection Act (Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz, HinSchG).

**Reporting channels:**

- **Direct report:** Speak to your manager, Julia Meier (HR), or Dr. Martin Schreiber (CEO)
- **Email:** compliance@techvision-gmbh.de (monitored by HR and legal counsel)
- **Anonymous reporting:** An anonymous tip line is available at https://techvision-gmbh.trustbox.eu (operated by an independent third party)

**Protection guarantees:**

- No employee will face retaliation, disadvantage, or disciplinary action for making a good-faith report of suspected misconduct.
- Reports are investigated confidentially by the appropriate parties (HR, legal counsel, or external investigators as necessary).
- The identity of the reporter is protected to the extent permitted by law.
- Retaliatory actions against whistleblowers constitute a serious violation of this Code and will result in disciplinary consequences.

## 8. Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct are taken seriously. Depending on the severity, consequences may include:

- Verbal or written warning
- Mandatory additional training
- Reassignment or removal from a project
- Termination of employment
- Referral to law enforcement authorities (in cases involving criminal conduct)

All employees acknowledge this Code of Conduct as part of their onboarding process (see *New Employee Onboarding Checklist*, doc_005). Annual reaffirmation is requested as part of the performance review cycle.
