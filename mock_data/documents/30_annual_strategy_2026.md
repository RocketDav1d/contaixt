# TechVision GmbH – Annual Strategy & Goals 2026

**Prepared by:** Dr. Martin Schreiber (CEO)
**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Board Approved:** December 18, 2025
**Distribution:** All Employees (after board approval)
**Classification:** Internal – Confidential until January 6, 2026

## Vision Statement

TechVision GmbH aims to become the **leading mid-market IT consulting firm in the DACH region** for data-driven transformation. We help companies with 200-5,000 employees modernize their technology, unlock the value of their data, and compete effectively in an increasingly digital economy.

Our competitive advantage lies at the intersection of deep technical expertise, mid-market focus, and genuine client partnership. We are not trying to be the next Accenture or McKinsey — we are building something different: a consulting firm where every client gets senior attention, every project gets our best talent, and every engagement creates lasting value.

## 2025 in Review

Before looking ahead, it is important to acknowledge what we accomplished in 2025:

- **Revenue:** €7.5M (target was €7.0M, +18% year-over-year from €6.35M in 2024)
- **Headcount:** Grew from 68 to 78 employees (+15%)
- **Major wins:** Muller Maschinenbau AG (Projekt Aurora, €450k), FinSecure Bank AG (€280k), MedTech Solutions GmbH (€195k)
- **Client satisfaction:** NPS improved from 52 to 67 over the course of the year (doc_025)
- **Microsoft Gold Partnership renewed** with Data & AI competency added
- **Monthly tech talks launched** — building a learning culture (doc_025, doc_028)

These results give us a strong foundation. But the market is moving fast, and standing still means falling behind. The 2026 strategy is designed to accelerate our growth while maintaining the quality and culture that make TechVision special.

## 2026 Revenue Target

**Target: €9,000,000** (+20% year-over-year)

| Revenue Stream | 2025 Actual | 2026 Target | Growth |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Consulting (Projects) | €5,600,000 | €6,750,000 | +20.5% |
| Managed Services | €1,200,000 | €1,500,000 | +25.0% |
| Training & Workshops | €400,000 | €450,000 | +12.5% |
| Partnership Revenue | €300,000 | €300,000 | 0% |
| **Total** | **€7,500,000** | **€9,000,000** | **+20.0%** |

The 20% growth target is ambitious but achievable. It requires disciplined execution across four strategic pillars, a focused hiring plan, and continued investment in our capabilities and partnerships.

## Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: Deepen the Healthcare Vertical

**Goal:** Win 3 new healthcare clients in 2026
**Owner:** Thomas Kruger (Sales), Lisa Weber (Delivery)

Our engagement with MedTech Solutions GmbH (doc_025, doc_026) marks our entry into the healthcare vertical — a market with enormous potential for data-driven transformation. Healthcare organizations in the DACH region face unique challenges: strict regulatory requirements (GDPR, MDR, EU AI Act), fragmented data systems, and increasing pressure to improve patient outcomes through analytics.

**Why healthcare:**
- Large addressable market: over 2,000 mid-market healthcare companies in DACH
- High barriers to entry (regulatory expertise) create competitive moats
- Long client relationships (regulated industries change vendors infrequently)
- Strong alignment with our data platform and compliance capabilities

**Actions:**
1. Develop a healthcare-specific data platform reference architecture by Q2 2026 (led by Anna Richter)
2. Hire 1 healthcare domain consultant with clinical data experience by Q1 2026
3. Publish the MedTech Solutions case study (pending client approval) by Q2 2026
4. Targeted outreach to 15 healthcare companies in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg (Thomas Kruger)
5. Attend DMEA (Digital Medical Expertise & Applications) conference in Berlin, April 2026

**Revenue target from healthcare vertical: €800,000 in 2026** (from €195,000 in 2025)

### Pillar 2: Launch AI/ML Practice

**Goal:** Establish a dedicated AI/ML practice with 3 ML engineers by Q2 2026
**Owner:** Sandra Hoffmann (CTO)

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are no longer experimental technologies — they are becoming core requirements for data-driven organizations. Our clients are asking about predictive maintenance (AutoParts24, doc_026), anomaly detection (FinSecure Bank), and intelligent automation. We need to move from ad hoc AI capabilities to a structured practice.

**Current state:**
- Anna Richter has ML experience (Python, scikit-learn, basic deep learning)
- Felix Braun has built data pipelines that feed ML models
- No dedicated ML engineers on staff
- No standardized MLOps capabilities

**Target state by end of 2026:**
- 3 dedicated ML engineers (1 senior, 2 mid-level)
- Standardized MLOps pipeline (MLflow, Azure ML, or equivalent)
- 2 completed AI/ML client projects
- Internal AI tools for knowledge management and code review

**Actions:**
1. Hire 1 Senior ML Engineer by end of Q1 2026 — this is the critical hire that will anchor the practice. Julia Meier is already sourcing candidates through specialized recruiters and our university network (TU Munich, LMU).
2. Hire 2 ML Engineers by end of Q2 2026
3. Define AI/ML service offerings and pricing by Q1 2026 (Sandra Hoffmann)
4. Build internal proof-of-concept projects to develop team capabilities (Q1-Q2)
5. Partner with Databricks for ML platform projects (doc_027)

**Revenue target from AI/ML practice: €500,000 in 2026** (greenfield)

### Pillar 3: Expand to Austria (Vienna Office)

**Goal:** Open a Vienna office by Q3 2026
**Owner:** Dr. Martin Schreiber (CEO), Thomas Kruger (Sales)

The Austrian market offers strong growth potential for IT consulting, particularly in Vienna's financial services and manufacturing sectors. Several of our existing clients have Austrian subsidiaries, and we have received inbound inquiries from Vienna-based companies who found us through our Microsoft partnership.

**Why Vienna:**
- Strong financial services sector (banks, insurance) with data modernization needs
- Growing tech ecosystem with good talent availability
- German-speaking market — no language barrier for our team
- Geographic proximity to Munich (1 hour flight, 4 hours drive)

**Actions:**
1. Market research and target client identification by Q1 2026
2. Hire 1 Country Manager / Senior Sales for Austria by Q2 2026
3. Establish legal entity (GmbH) in Austria by Q2 2026 (Petra Neumann to coordinate with legal counsel)
4. Secure flexible office space in Vienna (co-working initially) by Q3 2026
5. Hire 2-3 local consultants in Vienna by Q4 2026
6. Target: 2 Austrian clients signed by end of 2026

**Revenue target from Austria: €400,000 in 2026** (H2 only, ramp-up year)

### Pillar 4: Achieve AWS Advanced Partner Status

**Goal:** AWS Select Tier by Q3 2026, Advanced Tier by Q4 2026
**Owner:** Sandra Hoffmann (CTO), Felix Braun (Technical Lead)

While Azure remains our primary cloud platform, multi-cloud is the reality for many of our clients. Achieving AWS Advanced Partner status will position us to compete for multi-cloud engagements and access AWS's partner referral pipeline. Sandra Hoffmann's partnership strategy (doc_027) details the full rationale and investment plan.

**Actions:**
1. Certify 6 engineers on AWS (4 SA Associate, 2 Developer Associate) by Q3 2026
2. Deliver 3 referenceable AWS customer engagements by Q3 2026
3. Achieve $50,000 monthly AWS customer spend influence by Q4 2026
4. Assign Felix Braun as AWS Practice Lead

**Revenue target from AWS engagements: €600,000 in 2026** (from €200,000 in 2025)

## Hiring Plan

To support our growth ambitions, we plan to hire **15 new employees** in 2026, growing from 78 to approximately 93:

| Role Category | Hires | Timeline | Key Roles |
|---------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Engineering (Cloud & Data) | 5 | Q1-Q3 | 2 Senior Cloud Engineers, 2 Data Engineers, 1 Platform Engineer |

| Operations | 2 | Q2-Q4 | 1 Finance Analyst (Vienna), 1 People Operations |
| **Total** | **15** | | |

**Total hiring investment:** Approximately €180,000 in recruitment costs (agency fees, job postings, employer branding). Julia Meier will lead recruiting efforts, supported by an external recruitment agency for specialized roles (ML engineers, Austria Country Manager).

The talent market remains competitive, particularly for senior engineers and ML specialists (doc_025). Our strategies to address this include:

- Updated compensation bands (benchmarked against Munich market + 10% for key roles)
- Enhanced employer branding (careers page refresh, LinkedIn content strategy)
- Remote-first option for specialized roles (expanding talent pool beyond Munich)
- University partnerships (TU Munich, LMU, TU Wien for Austrian hires)

## Risk Factors

### 1. Economic Slowdown

The German economy has shown mixed signals, with manufacturing sentiment softening. A significant recession could delay client spending decisions and compress deal sizes.

**Mitigation:** Diversify across verticals (manufacturing, finance, healthcare) and geographies (Germany, Austria). Maintain managed services revenue as a stabilizing base. Keep fixed costs flexible — use contractor capacity for peak demand rather than over-hiring.

### 2. Talent Competition

Munich is one of Europe's most competitive tech talent markets. Large tech companies (Google, Apple, Microsoft), well-funded startups, and other consulting firms compete for the same senior engineers and ML specialists.

**Mitigation:** Competitive compensation (benchmarked + 10%), strong culture and learning opportunities (doc_028), remote-first options for specialized roles, university partnerships. Julia Meier's employer branding initiative is critical.

### 3. Key Person Dependency

Several critical capabilities are concentrated in individual team members:
- **Felix Braun:** Primary senior developer for complex architectures
- **Anna Richter:** Sole data engineering lead
- **Markus Lang:** DevOps and infrastructure expertise
- **Thomas Kruger:** Primary client relationship owner for major accounts

Loss of any of these individuals would create significant delivery and business continuity risk.

**Mitigation:** Cross-training program (already underway for Projekt Aurora team, doc_025), documentation of critical knowledge, competitive retention packages, and the mentorship program (doc_028) to develop backup capabilities.

### 4. Partnership Execution Risk

Our 2026 strategy relies significantly on partnership-driven revenue (€2M target). If partnership investments do not yield expected referrals — for example, if the AWS partnership takes longer to mature or the Databricks referral pipeline is slower than expected — we will face a revenue gap.

**Mitigation:** Conservative partnership revenue assumptions (pipeline weighted). Maintain direct sales capacity independent of partnerships. Regular partnership ROI reviews with Sandra Hoffmann (doc_027).

### 5. Austria Expansion Complexity

International expansion, even to a neighboring German-speaking country, introduces legal, tax, and cultural complexities. There is a risk that the Austrian office takes longer to become productive than planned.

**Mitigation:** Start lean (co-working space, 1 Country Manager), validate market demand before scaling. Petra Neumann is engaging experienced legal counsel for Austrian corporate setup. Set clear go/no-go milestones at Q2 and Q3 2026.

---

## Governance & Review Cadence

- **Monthly:** Leadership team review of financial performance, hiring progress, and project delivery status
- **Quarterly:** Full OKR review with scoring and adjustment
- **Mid-year (June 2026):** Strategic review — assess progress against pillars, adjust investment allocations, go/no-go decision on Austria scaling
- **Annual (December 2026):** Full strategy review and 2027 planning

---

## Closing Remarks

2025 was a year of strong growth and foundation-building for TechVision GmbH. We proved that our model works — deep technical expertise, mid-market focus, genuine client partnerships. We delivered for Muller Maschinenbau (doc_029), won trust from FinSecure Bank and MedTech Solutions, and built the internal capabilities to support our ambitions.

2026 is the year we scale. The four strategic pillars — healthcare, AI/ML, Austria, and AWS — represent carefully chosen bets that leverage our existing strengths while expanding our addressable market. The €9M revenue target is ambitious, and reaching it will require disciplined execution, smart hiring, and continued investment in our people and partnerships.

I am deeply grateful for the dedication and talent of every person at TechVision. Our culture — collaborative, curious, committed to excellence — is our greatest asset. As we grow, preserving and strengthening that culture is not just a nice-to-have; it is a strategic imperative.

Let us make 2026 our best year yet.
