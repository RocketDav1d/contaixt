# Training & Development Budget 2026

**Prepared by:** Julia Meier (HR Manager)
**Date:** November 12, 2025
**Distribution:** Leadership Team
**Classification:** Internal

---

## Overview

Investing in our people is one of TechVision GmbH's core commitments. As we scale from 78 to approximately 93 employees in 2026 (doc_030), our training and development program must keep pace with both business needs and individual growth aspirations. This document presents the 2026 training budget of **€120,000**, representing an average investment of approximately **€1,500 per employee** — a figure that is competitive within the German IT consulting market (industry average: €1,200-1,800).

The 2026 budget reflects a 20% increase over 2025 (€100,000), driven by expanded certification requirements from our partnership strategy (doc_027) and the launch of new practice areas, particularly AI/ML.

## Certification Priorities

### Azure Certifications (8 people, €16,000)

Azure remains our primary cloud platform and the foundation of our Microsoft Gold Partnership (doc_027). Sandra Hoffmann has identified the following certification targets:

| Certification | Target Employees | Cost per Person | Total |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-305) | 4 | €2,000 | €8,000 |

**Target employees:**
- Azure Solutions Architect: Markus Lang, Felix Braun, and 2 senior engineers (to be hired in Q1)
- Azure Data Engineer: Anna Richter, and 3 data engineers (including new hires)

Costs include exam fees (€165 per attempt), official Microsoft learning paths, and practice exams. We budget for potential retakes.

Additionally, Markus Lang will pursue the **AKS Specialty** certification as part of the Azure Expert MSP preparation. This is included in the Kubernetes budget below.

### AWS Certifications (4 people, €5,000)

Per the partnership strategy (doc_027), we are pursuing AWS Select Tier partner status. Four engineers need the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification by Q3 2026.

| Certification | Target Employees | Cost per Person | Total |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) | 4 | €1,250 | €5,000 |

**Target employees:** Felix Braun, 1 current senior engineer, and 2 new hires. Felix Braun already has significant AWS experience and is expected to certify in Q1.

### Kubernetes Certifications (5 people, €7,500)

Container orchestration is a core capability across all our cloud engagements. Markus Lang's DevOps team needs formalized Kubernetes expertise.

## Conference Budget (€25,000)

Conferences serve a dual purpose: professional development and business development. Thomas Kruger and I have aligned on the following priority events for 2026:

| Conference | Location | Date | Attendees | Budget |
|------------|----------|------|-----------|--------|
| OOP Conference | Munich | February 2026 | 4 | €4,000 |
| KubeCon Europe | London | March 2026 | 3 | €7,500 |
| PyCon DE | Berlin | April 2026 | 3 | €3,500 |
| Data & AI Summit | Munich | June 2026 | 3 | €4,000 |
| Microsoft Inspire | (Virtual) | July 2026 | 2 | €1,000 |
| re:Invent (AWS) | Las Vegas | December 2026 | 2 | €5,000 |

Selection criteria: technical relevance, networking value, and alignment with our strategic verticals (manufacturing, financial services, healthcare). Where possible, we encourage our team members to submit speaking proposals — Sandra Hoffmann's talk at the Data & AI Summit Munich in November 2025 generated significant lead interest (doc_026).

## Learning Platforms (€23,000)

### Pluralsight (€15,000)

Enterprise license for all engineering staff (approximately 50 people in 2026). Pluralsight provides on-demand video courses for Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Python, and security topics. Usage analytics from 2025 show an average of 4.2 hours per employee per month — above the industry average of 3.1 hours.

### O'Reilly Safari (€8,000)

Thirty licenses for senior engineers and technical leads. O'Reilly provides access to books, live events, and interactive labs. Particularly valuable for deep-dive topics like distributed systems architecture, ML engineering, and database internals. Felix Braun and Anna Richter are among the heaviest users.

---

## Internal Knowledge Sharing Programs

### Monthly Tech Talks

Launched in August 2025 (doc_025), our internal tech talk series has been a success. Average attendance is 35 people per session. For 2026, we plan to:

- Continue monthly cadence (12 sessions per year)
- Invite external guest speakers (2-3 times per year, budget: €3,000)
- Record and archive talks on our internal knowledge base
- Budget: €5,000 (catering, A/V equipment, guest speaker fees)

Recent popular topics have included "Terraform Best Practices" by Markus Lang and "Graph Databases for Entity Resolution" by Anna Richter.

### Quarterly Hackathons

New for 2026. Two-day hackathons held quarterly where cross-functional teams work on internal innovation projects. Goals:

- Foster innovation and cross-team collaboration
- Generate ideas for new service offerings or internal tools
- Build team cohesion (especially important as we grow to 90+ people)
- Budget: €3,000 (prizes, catering, infrastructure costs)

Felix Braun has volunteered to organize the first hackathon in Q1 2026, themed around "AI-powered internal tools."

## Mentorship Program

We are formalizing our mentorship program for 2026, aimed at junior and mid-level developers. The program pairs each mentee with a senior engineer for a 6-month period with structured goals and monthly check-ins.

**Structure:**
- 10 mentor-mentee pairs in 2026
- Monthly 1:1 sessions (1 hour)
- Quarterly mentorship group workshops
- Mentor training for senior engineers (half-day workshop)
- Budget: €5,500 (mentor training, workshop facilitation, materials)

Sandra Hoffmann, Felix Braun, Anna Richter, and Markus Lang have all agreed to serve as mentors. This program directly addresses the retention challenge highlighted in the quarterly review (doc_025) — we lost two team members in Q3, and exit interviews indicated that career development opportunities are a key factor in retention decisions.

---

## New Hire Onboarding (€10,000)

With 15 planned new hires in 2026 (doc_030), a structured onboarding program is essential. The budget covers:

- **Week 1:** Company orientation, tooling setup, security training (led by Tobias Fischer)
- **Week 2:** Technical onboarding — architecture overview, codebase walkthrough, pair programming
- **Week 3-4:** Supervised client project work with a buddy
- Materials, welcome kits, and onboarding platform costs: €10,000

---

## Management & Leadership Development (€5,000)

As we grow, developing our next generation of leaders is critical. Budget covers:

- Leadership workshop for team leads (2-day offsite): €3,000
- Executive coaching for 2 high-potential managers: €2,000

Petra Neumann and Lisa Weber have been identified as candidates for the executive coaching program, reflecting their growing responsibilities in finance and project management respectively.

---

## Approval & Governance

This budget has been reviewed by Petra Neumann (Finance/Controlling) and is within the overall 2026 operating budget framework. Martin Schreiber has provisionally approved the budget pending final board approval of the 2026 annual strategy (doc_030, board approval expected December 18, 2025).

Training spend will be tracked monthly against budget, with a mid-year review in June 2026 to adjust allocations based on actual hiring pace and project needs.
